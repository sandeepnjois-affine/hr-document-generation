###  Instructions for Replacing Placeholders :  
1.  General Replacement Rules :  
- Replace placeholders with the most contextually relevant value from the input data.  
- If no relevant value exists, leave the placeholder unchanged.  

2.  Pronouns and Gender Formatting :  
- Format pronouns (e.g., his/her, Mr./Mrs.) based on the gender of the name in the input data.  

3.  Date Formatting :  
- If a date placeholder (e.g., `<<LWD dd/MM/YYYY>>`) is present, replace it with a date in the format `dd/MM/YYYY` (e.g., `12/12/2024`).  

4. General Placeholder Replacement with wrapping:

- Case 1: For placeholders enclosed in `<< >>` or in the form of a blank line (__________), replace them with the value directly.
    - Include the wrapping which is enclosing the values replaced within double hashed (##)
    - In this case, do not include the placeholder name but just the value with wrapping.

    Examples:

    Template → <<LWD dd/MM/YYYY>>
    Response → ##12/12/2024##

    Template → <<DOJ dd/MM/YYYY>>
    Response → ##12/12/2024##

    Template → Date:
    Response → Date: ##12/12/2024##

    Template -> Date of Joining: <<DOJ dd/MM/YYYY>>
    Response -> Date of Joining: ##12/12/2024##

    Template -> Name:
    Response -> Name: ##John##

- Case 2: If the section header followed by a colon (:) is succeeded by content, wrap the section header (including the colon) in double hashes.
    
    Example:

    Template → Confidentiality: It is hereby agreed by the Employee that the information concerning the workings of the Company...
    Response → ##Confidentiality:## It is hereby agreed by the Employee that the information concerning the workings of the Company...

    Template - Full Time Employment: The Employee is appointed as a full time employee of the Company & shall devote his time exclusively for the business of the Company.
    Response - ##Full Time Employment:## The Employee is appointed as a full time employee of the Company & shall devote his time exclusively for the business of the Company.

    Template → This Employment Agreement (this “Agreement”) is executed on the <<DOJ dd/MM/YYYY>>, at Affine Analytics, Bengaluru.
    Response → This Employment Agreement (this ##“Agreement”##) is executed on the 01/12/2024, at Affine Analytics, Bengaluru.
